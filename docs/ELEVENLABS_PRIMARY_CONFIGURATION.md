# ElevenLabs Primary Configuration

## Overview
ElevenLabs has been configured as the PRIMARY audio service for LinguApp, providing high-quality text-to-speech for all language learning activities.

## Configuration Changes

### 1. UnifiedAudioService (`services/unifiedAudioService.ts`)
- **ElevenLabs** is now the PRIMARY service
- **Google Voice** serves as the FALLBACK service
- **Browser TTS** serves as the FINAL FALLBACK

#### Service Priority Order:
1. **ElevenLabs** (Primary) - High-quality, natural voices
2. **Google Voice** (Fallback) - Reliable cloud TTS
3. **Browser TTS** (Final Fallback) - Local browser synthesis

### 2. useUniversalAudio Hook (`hooks/useUniversalAudio.tsx`)
- Updated to prioritize ElevenLabs by default
- All audio functions now use ElevenLabs first
- Maintains fallback capabilities for reliability

### 3. Convenience Functions
All convenience functions now use ElevenLabs as primary:
- `playLessonAudio()` - Premium quality with ElevenLabs
- `playExerciseAudio()` - Premium quality with ElevenLabs
- `playQuickAudio()` - Standard quality with ElevenLabs

## API Key Configuration

### Environment Variable
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_66fcceb70d6b297967ed1ecd64d78a0183cfb8585971cc0b
```

## Testing

### Test Button
A test button has been added to the welcome screen:

- **Function**: Tests ElevenLabs integration
- **Message**: Confirms ElevenLabs is working as primary service

### Test Process
1. Initialize ElevenLabs service
2. Generate speech with Adam voice
3. Play audio through device
4. Display success message with details

## Usage Examples

### Basic Text-to-Speech
```typescript
import { unifiedAudioService } from '@/services/unifiedAudioService';

// This will use ElevenLabs first, then fallback to Google Voice
const result = await unifiedAudioService.playText("Hello, world!", {
  language: 'en',
  quality: 'premium'
});
```

### Using the Hook
```typescript
import { useUniversalAudio } from '@/hooks/useUniversalAudio';

const { playText, playVocabulary } = useUniversalAudio();

// All functions now use ElevenLabs as primary
await playText("Hello, world!", { language: 'en' });
await playVocabulary("hello", 'en');
```
