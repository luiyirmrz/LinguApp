## Framework Architecture Overview

### User Language Configuration
```typescript
// Users can set:
- Main Language (UI): Any of the 6 supported languages
- Target Language (Learning): Any other supported language
- Interface Preferences: Translations, phonetics, audio settings
```

### CEFR-Based Progression
```
A1 (Beginner) ‚Üí A2 (Elementary) ‚Üí B1 (Intermediate) ‚Üí 
B2 (Upper Intermediate) ‚Üí C1 (Advanced) ‚Üí C2 (Proficient)
```

### Exercise Types Supported
1. **Word-to-Image Matching** - Visual vocabulary learning
2. **Sentence Building Puzzles** - Grammar and word order
3. **Fill in the Blank** - Context and grammar practice
4. **Listening Challenges** - Audio comprehension
5. **Speaking Challenges** - Pronunciation practice
6. **Flashcard/Memory Games** - Spaced repetition
7. **Adaptive Review** - Personalized weak area practice

### Content Structure
```typescript
// Every lesson follows this schema:
LessonContentSchema {
  lessonId: string;
  mainLanguage: string;    // UI language
  targetLanguage: string;  // Learning language
  level: CEFRLevel;        // A1-C2
  content: {
    instruction: MultilingualContent;  // In both languages
    question: MultilingualContent;     // In both languages
    explanation: MultilingualContent;  // In both languages
  };
  gameContent?: GameContent;  // Interactive game data
  metadata: {
    difficulty: 1-5;
    xpReward: number;
    skills: string[];
    topics: string[];
  };
}
```

## Key Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Adaptive Learning System
- Performance tracking with accuracy and response time
- Automatic difficulty adjustment based on user performance
- Spaced repetition algorithm for long-term retention
- Weak area identification and targeted practice

### ‚úÖ Progress Tracking
- Per-language progress with separate XP, levels, and achievements
- Cross-language statistics and overall learning metrics
- Streak tracking and achievement system
- Time spent learning per language

### ‚úÖ Content Validation
- Automatic validation of multilingual content completeness
- Schema validation for lesson structure
- Content quality checks and error reporting

### ‚úÖ Flexible Content Generation
- Helper functions for generating unique IDs
- Template system for creating new lessons
- Modular skill and module organization
- Easy content localization

## What's Ready for Implementation

### 1. Content Generation Pipeline
The framework is ready to generate comprehensive lesson sets:
```typescript
// Example: Create Spanish lessons for English speakers
const spanishCourse = createLanguageCourse(
  'es', // target language
  'en', // main language
  modules, // generated modules
  courseDescription
);
```

### 2. Game Development
All game types have defined interfaces and can be implemented:
- Word-image matching with drag & drop
- Sentence building with word tiles
- Audio-based listening challenges
- Speech recognition for speaking practice

### 3. Database Integration
Schema is defined for:
- Multilingual lesson storage (JSONB for content)
- User progress tracking per language
- Performance analytics and adaptive difficulty

### 4. User Interface Adaptation
Framework supports:
- Dynamic UI language switching
- Content display in user's preferred language
- Contextual translations and explanations
- Cultural adaptation of content

## Next Steps for Full Implementation
