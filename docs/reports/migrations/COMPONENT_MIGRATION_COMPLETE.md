## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS

### Unified State Management
```typescript
// Before: Mixed state management
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);

// After: Unified store integration
const { signIn, isLoading, error, clearError } = useAuth();
```

### Performance Optimizations
```typescript
// Before: Unoptimized handlers
const handleSignIn = async () => { /* ... */ };

// After: Optimized with useCallback
const handleSignIn = useCallback(async () => {
  // Optimized implementation
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Before: Local error management
const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});

// After: Centralized error handling
const displayError = useMemo(() => error || Object.values(errors)[0], [error, errors]);
```

### Error Boundaries
```typescript
// Before: No error protection
return <SafeAreaView>...</SafeAreaView>;

// After: Protected with error boundary
return (
  <OptimizedErrorBoundary>
    <SafeAreaView>...</SafeAreaView>
  </OptimizedErrorBoundary>
);
```

## 📊 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

### Bundle Size Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Components ready for lazy loading
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code elimination
- **Import Optimization**: Selective imports from unified store

### Runtime Performance
- **Memoization**: Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- **Optimized Selectors**: Selective state subscriptions
- **Callback Optimization**: Prevented function recreation on each render

### Memory Management
- **Error Boundary Cleanup**: Proper error state management
- **Optimized Data Flow**: Efficient state updates
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Store Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Consistent pattern across all components
const { user } = useAuth();
const { points, level, gems, hearts } = useGamification();
const { progress } = useLearning();
const { targetLanguage } = useLanguage();
```

### Performance Optimization Pattern
```typescript
// Consistent optimization pattern
const userData = useMemo(() => ({
  // Computed data
}), [dependencies]);

const handleAction = useCallback(() => {
  // Optimized handler
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
// Consistent error handling
const displayError = useMemo(() => error || Object.values(errors)[0], [error, errors]);

return (
  <OptimizedErrorBoundary>
    {/* Component content */}
    {displayError && <ErrorDisplay error={displayError} />}
  </OptimizedErrorBoundary>
);
```
